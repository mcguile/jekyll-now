Welcome to my blog. Here I discuss current and future technologies, and rant a bit about my life. 

During the summer of 2018, I was lucky enough to have been awarded a scholarship to intern at Envision Solar in San Diego, California, as a User Experience / User Interface Engineer. My project for the company was to research an an Internet of Things database platform, determine a suitable databause structure, write Python scripts to enable autonomous data upload from each commercial system, and develop accompanying Android and iOS applications for customers to view their realtime system statuses from anywhere in the world. My failings and rare successes are documented along with all the cultural experiences.

Thanks for taking the time to read. Feel free to comment on any of the posts!
