Welcome to my blog. Here I discuss all things regarding current and future technologies, travel, and computer  programming. During the summer of 2018, I am lucky enough to have been awarded a scholarship to intern at Envision Solar in San Diego, California. My project for the company is to research and develop an Internet of Things platform and accompanying Android, iOS, and web apps for customers to view data and control their autonomous systems from anywhere in the world. My failings and rare successes are documented in the Tech Talks section, and all the cultural experiences are splurged in the Saltire Scholarship section.
