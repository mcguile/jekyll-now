Welcome to my blog. Here I discuss all things regarding current and future technologies, travel, and computer  programming. During the summer of 2018, I am lucky enough to have been awarded a scholarship to intern at Envision Solar in San Diego, California. My project for the company is to research an an Internet of Things databse platform and develop accompanying Android and iOS applications for customers to view data and control their autonomous systems from anywhere in the world. My failings and rare successes will be documented along with all the cultural experiences.

Thanks for taking the time to read. Feel free to comment on any of the posts!
